## 🧠 Project Overview

This project presents the design, simulation, and analysis of a **Helical Antenna operating at 3 GHz**, developed as part of the **Microwave Lab** coursework. The antenna was designed to operate in **axial mode** using **Ansys HFSS**, providing **high gain**, **broadband performance**, and **circular polarization**—ideal for satellite communication, GPS, and remote sensing applications.

All design parameters were derived using theoretical models from **Balanis' Antenna Theory**, with a focus on impedance matching, axial ratio optimization, and beamwidth calculation.

## 🎯 Impedance Matching Strategy

The typical input impedance of a helical antenna in axial mode is between 140–200 Ω. A **tapered impedance matching section** was introduced at the antenna base to smoothly transition to a 50 Ω feed line, ensuring **efficient power transfer** and **minimal signal reflection**.
